"# RAP_Tables" 
This git project has been created for the dissemination and further development of tables using RAP. The first files that have been uploaded are prototype versions. 

Automation Tool:

The aim of this tool is to provide a framework to plug data in to. The aim is to reduce the need for the user to understand a significant amount of R to create headers, footers etc., to allow RAP to be implemented without the need for significant upskilling.

Sanctions Automation Prototype:

This is a proof of concept piece whose main aim was to show that R can be utilised to produce reproducable tables. It is currently unfinished, but can be used as a tool to aid development of other tables or to show the utility of R to produce tables. Please note that the metadata and other information in the R code is historic and based on a publication from January 2018.
